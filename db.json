Selenium eliminates the fungus that causes dandruff, which is why it's used in many hair treatments. It also regulates hormones and enzymes to activate antioxidants, which help fight free radical damage. In hair Recovery Complex (Amino acids), the optimal level of keratin production can be achieved by consuming enough amino acids. Hair development can be accelerated as a result of adequate keratin production. Amino acids, in addition to keratin formation, can increase red blood cell production. Increased red blood cell production can also aid in transferring oxygen and nutrients to the hair follicles, resulting in improved hair growth.",
