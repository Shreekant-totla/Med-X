Their tender minds and fragile bodies bear the stress that might make them weak and vulnerable to viral and bacterial infections. The ongoing sedentary and exhausting lifestyle is draining their energies, and the requisite amounts of omega 3 fatty acids, vitamin A, and vitamin D are hardly met. As a result, they, especially children, can develop a weak immune system, becoming more vulnerable to infections affecting their overall health. Adding Seacod cod liver oil to the daily diet can support better health. Seacod is India’s largest selling cod liver oil*. It is an omega 3 supplement with added vitamin A and D, which can be elemental in developing an active, healthy lifestyle throughout the year. This cod in liver oil for women, men, and kids is an ideal way to meet the required nutritional gaps. Here are some science-backed facts to support the importance of cod liver oil in the diet. A study by the Journal of Dietary Supplements has revealed that children deficient in omega 3 fatty acids can tend to show signs of behavioural disorders, lack of concentration, and poor performance on the educational front. Also, a large-scale survey by Statista in 2019 revealed that 70% of Indian women and 59% of Indian men were unhealthy. These facts stress the need for cod liver oil as a dietary supplement.",
